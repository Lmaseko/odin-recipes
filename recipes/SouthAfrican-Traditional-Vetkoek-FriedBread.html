      <p>
        You can make them any size you wish; they're a great party snack when
        made small. They can be filled with meat, tuna and mayo, syrup, curried
        minced meat, cheese, or basically anything you feel like using.
      </p>

      <p>They're fast, easy, and very tasty.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>Â¼ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
      <li>7 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
      <li>3 cups oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="steps-header">Steps:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 1:</h3>
        Mix lukewarm water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until
        yeast softens and bubbles slightly, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 2:</h3>
        Sift together flour and salt in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 3:</h3>
        Pour yeast mixture over flour mixture and knead until dough is smooth
        and elastic, 5 to 7 minutes. Cover bowl with a clean cloth and let dough
        rise until doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 4:</h3>
        Pinch off a piece of dough about the size of a tennis ball; roll until
        smooth. Flatten ball of dough until it is palm-sized; set aside on a
        floured work surface. Repeat with remaining dough.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 5:</h3>
        Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees
        C).
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Step 6:</h3>
        Fry in hot oil, 2 to 3 pieces at a time, until golden brown, about 3
        minutes per side. Drain on paper towels.
      </li>
