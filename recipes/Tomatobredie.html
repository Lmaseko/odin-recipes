<h2>Tomato bredie is a popular South African meal and good winter fare.</h2>
<p>Bredie is an old Cape name for a dish of meat and vegetables stewed together so that the flavors intermingle. 
    The gravy is rich, thick, and full-bodied and obtained by using meat with a fair amount of bone and fat, 
    rolling it in flour, and browning it before the vegetables are added. 
</p>

<p>The flavor improves if left a day or two before eating. Nice with brown rice.</p>
